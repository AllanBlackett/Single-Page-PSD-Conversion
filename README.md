# Single Page PSD Conversion - Juno Project #1

Juno College project 1. My objective is to show that I can take a PSD and convert it into a functional, responsive website.

## Project Description

This project is meant to emulate a common task I would normally perform as a front-end developer. I was provided a design and was tasked with building it with only HTML and CSS. The goals here are to execute the designer's vision on the web, and to build a good experience for my users regardless of the device on which they are viewing the site.

## Project Requirement

-Site is responsive and uses media queries.

-Wrapper used to constrain content on large displays.

-Semantic HTML elements are used properly.

-One external .css stylesheet is used for whole project (no SASS).

-Setup snippet is used.

-All images considered content have descriptive alt text.

-Floats and .clearfix are used properly.

-Google web fonts are used.

-Project represents the provided design well.

-Files, folders, & naming conventions followed (kabob-case) (this includes my project repo).
