# PSD Website Coverter
Juno College tasked Project taking a PSD and converting it into a functional, responsive website.

## Project Description
This project is meant to emulate a common task I would normally perform as a front-end developer. I was provided a design and I was tasked with building it. The goals here are to execute the designer's vision on the web, and to build a good experience for my users regardless of the device on which they are viewing the site.
